## Abstract

In tone languages such as Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese, word meaning is not only determined by lexical pronunciation but it is also determined by the manipulation of pitch in every character. In Mandarin Chinese, there are four ways in which pitch can be manipulated, called tones: The first tone is high and level; the second starts low and moderately rises; the third falls and then rises again; the fourth starts high, but drops sharply to the bottom of the tonal range. This study aims at verifying if the production of lexical Mandarin tones varies as a function of musical aptitude and musical exposure. Thirty-one students in their third-year of taking Mandarin at Stuyvesant High School completed a survey for musical exposure and a musical battery for musical aptitude. They then submitted recordings of their voice to undergo pitch analysis process to measure their ability to pronounce Mandarin tones. Initial results show a moderate positive correlation between one’s aptitude in tuning (as measured by PROMS subtest 5) and one’s ability to pronounce Mandarin tones.
